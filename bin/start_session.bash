# A note about the default callsign here...
#     This is the catch-all default callsign when operating in read-only (Internet) and receive-only (RF) mode.  It is NOT used
#     when a user has entered their callsign through the web setup screens (ex. under Setup-->System Configuration).  This doesn't
#     need to be edited.
CALLSIGN="E0SS"


# This is the elevation at the predicted landing location.  This is a starting value as the algorithm will auto-adjust this to 
# be equal to the launch site elevation.  This doesn't need to edited.
