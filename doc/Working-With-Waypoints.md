### Working With Waypoints

Use waypoints to mark rendezvous locations, critical road junctions, or other points on the map to aid navigation 
and balloon tracking efforts.  They can be added to the map screen with the HAB Tracker application, their popup 
content edited, and can even be moved to different locations.
