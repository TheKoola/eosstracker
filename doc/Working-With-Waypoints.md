# Working With Waypoints

Notes by Jeff N6BA, Dated 2019-02-18

## Overview ##

Use waypoints to mark rendezvous locations, critical road junctions, or other points on the map to aid navigation 
and balloon tracking efforts.  They can be added to the map screen with the HAB Tracker application, their popup 
content edited, and can even be moved to different locations.

It is important to note that waypoints will persist on your map until you either delete them or you reload the web 
page.  They do not persist across web page reloads (at least not yet).

## Adding a Waypoint To The Map

To add a waypoint onto your map click the ![Add Waypoint](assets/add_marker.png) icon on the right hand side of the screen.  
Once selected it should turn a blue color to indicate that you're in "add a new waypoint" mode.  If you change your mind, just
click the ![Add Waypoint](assets/add_marker.png) icon a second time and its color should change back to white indicating that
you're no longer in "add a waypoint" mode.

Just click on your desired map location to add a waypoint at that spot.

## Edit The Waypoint Popup Content

Just click on your new waypoint to display the initial popup content.

To tailor the popup content to something more meaningful, just click on it and start typing.  Once satisfied, click anywhere
else on the map to save your changes.

Once you click on this waypoint again, you'll see your newly added popup content.  Of course, you can always edit the
popup content as much as you want.

## Deleting a Waypoint

To delete a waypoint click the ![Delete Waypoint](assets/del_marker.png) icon on the right hand side of the screen.
Once selected it should turn a blue color to indicate that you're in "delete a waypoint" mode.  Then just click on the waypoint that you want to delete.

If you change your mind, just click the ![Delete Waypoint](assets/del_marker.png) icon a second time and its color should change back to white indicating that you're no longer in "delete a waypoint" mode.
