## System Configuration ##

The System Configuration section of the Setup screen allows one to enable two important features:
- Timezone - change the timezone used throughout the GUI interface
- Igating - automatic uploading of RF APRS packets to the Internet
- Beaconing - using an external radio to transmit an APRS packet containing one's position 

### Timezone ###

The timezone setting only changes the time used throughout the user interface and does not change the underlying system
timezone.  One can select an appropriate timezone to match the geographic location desired.
