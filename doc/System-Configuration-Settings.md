## System Configuration ##

The System Configuration section of the Setup screen allows one to enable two important features:
- Timezone - change the timezone used throughout the GUI interface
- Igating - automatic uploading of RF APRS packets to the Internet
- Beaconing - using an external radio to transmit an APRS packet containing one's position 

### Timezone ###

One can select an appropriate timezone to match the geographic location desired.  The timezone setting only changes the 
time used throughout the user interface and does not change the underlying system timezone.  All APRS packet data is 
saved to the database with a timezone which enables time offsets to be added or subtracted easily.  The end result is that it
really doesn't matter what timezone the underlying system and database are natively using as the user can change the displayed
timezone at anytime!
