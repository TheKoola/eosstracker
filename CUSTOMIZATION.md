## Making Local Customizations ##

The HAB Tracker application can be tailored to include site and/or organization information. There are two locations where customizations need to be applied:

- Add a graphics file (ex. PNG, JPG) containing your organization's brand graphics to the www/ directory.
- Edit the www/localinfo.php file to include localized information including a URL and brand graphic links 
- Edit the www/common/logo.php file to add the localized "name" of the app.
