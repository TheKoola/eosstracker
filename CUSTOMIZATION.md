## Making Local Customizations ##

The HAB Tracker application can be tailored to include site and/or organization information. There are two 
locations where customizations need to be applied in addition an image file containing one's brand graphic
needs to be uploaded.

1. Add a graphics file (ex. PNG, JPG) containing your organization's brand graphics to the `www` directory.
2. Edit the `www/localinfo.php` file to include localized information including a URL and brand graphic links.
3. Edit the `www/common/logo.php` file to add the localized "name" of the app.
